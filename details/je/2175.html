</div>
<p>Did you know that every year, an average of 40, 000 children in America have an injury or illness so serious that it requires that a parent alert medical services? Is it entirely inconceivable that you might not be at their side when this catastrophe occurs? Would your child or their friend know to call 911 if the worst should happen?</p>
<p>Leaving a sick child at home is a terrifying thought for parents and guardians alike. The thought of being unavailable to your child when you are needed most can be devastating. Whether your child clambers up a tree and takes a tumble, fracturing a limb, or suffers from a debilitating medical condition such as epilepsy, the reality is that we cannot keep tabs on our children around the clock (as much as we would like to).</p>
<p>It is a well-documented fact that children are actually more susceptible to injure themselves while at home. Why? It is the one place where a child feels the most secure and is more likely to take the risk of jumping off the back porch for the eleventh time or believing a sibling who tells them that the wild berries are candy (not that this writer has ever done that, of course). While we cannot be at the disposal of our tots and teenagers all the time, there are a number of ways in which we can mitigate the likelihood of injury or illness, however minor.</p>
<p><strong>1. Medical Alert ID Bracelets</strong></p>
<p>If your child has a life-threatening allergy, you are probably already familiar with medical alert jewelry. This small bracelet is emblazoned with the medical identification symbol for the American Medical Association. The medical alert bracelet will alert medical first attenders (or passersby) of conditions such as asthma, food allergies, epilepsy and diabetes. This information can be invaluable when seconds matter. If your child does not already, make sure they get one!</p>
<p><strong> 2. Household Cleaners &amp; Medication</strong></p>
<p>The old adage “out of sight, out of mind” applies here. While enviable, the curiosity of children can get them into a heap of trouble. It only takes a second for a child to wrestle the lid off the container of dishwasher tablets under the sink. Similarly, teenagers seem to be drawn to daredevil type activities that can make them sick or seriously injure them. Keep everyone safe by keeping household cleaners and medications out of reach and out of sight.</p>
<p><strong> 3. Medical Alert Devices</strong></p>
<p>More commonly used for assisting the elderly, if you have a child who struggles with a permanent medical condition a medical alert alarm could afford you and your family peace of mind. These small, inconspicuous medical alarms can be worn around the neck or wrist and have a large button affixed to them. In the event of an emergency at home, your child can press the medical alert button, which relays a message through the systems base and sound the medical alert alarm, making an immediate call to the response center. The response center will notify not only the authorities, but the listed emergency contact as well.</p>
<p>Have you ever dealt with a medical emergency at home? Are you confident in your child’s ability to alert medical and emergency services if the worst should come to pass?</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a new year, and of course, one of the things that comes to mind are travel plans for the impending vacations! A family vacation that involves the older folks can be a challenge to plan for and execute (as if it wasn’t hard enough when you have small children!), and the proper preparations and contingencies must be put in place in order to keep the family members’ spirits and bodies happy and healthy.</p>
<p>Like children, our senior folk have an array of special needs that must be met everyday and on particular situations, and in order for everyone to keep enjoying their very limited vacation time, these needs must be met. Based on my personal experience with my own gramps and nana, I shall create a short but complete checklist of things you should prepare for.</p>
<p><strong>Meds and Tools</strong><br>
First and foremost, the physical health of our beloved elderly must be cared for. This actually starts with their physician: he/she must provide you with a complete list of medicines and medical devices (nebulizers, syringes, etc.) that they will need while they travel.</p>
<p>It is important that all medications are stocked, and provide a generous allowance in amount just in case the vacation time is extended (whether it was intended to or not). Along with their regular medications, bring the basic assortment of meds for the usual ailments (colds, muscle pain, diarhhea, etc.).</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding naggy, check the expiration dates of the medicines, and know how to use the medical devices that they will need to be used.</p>
<p>Slightly related to meds; consider inoculations (vaccinations) for them, as well as everybody else making the trip.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility and Medical Alert Devices</strong><br>
Getting around can be a challenge for some of the seniors, so make sure you have the necessary aids to their movement and comfort. Things like walkers, crutches, wheelchairs, braces, crutches, and other related items are going to be on the bulkier side, so plan ahead and make room. Better yet, assign a younger member of the family to be the senior’s guardian for the trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greatcall.com/">Medical alert devices</a> are very effective tools to give your senior the option to call for help even when nobody is around to assist. There are also software-based solutions that run in smartphones and other computing gadgets.</p>
<p><strong>Sundries</strong><br>
Everyone needs the basic toiletries and other personal care items, but our elders will need a few more. Things like adult diapers, denture adhesive, and other assorted sundries must be considered and stocked sufficiently for the coming trip. This is especially needed if the venue for the vacation is a third world country, as not all supplies may be available in their local shops.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guyane-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/on-the-beach-with-grandparents.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-76" title="Enjoying the beach with family" src="http://www.guyane-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/on-the-beach-with-grandparents.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334"></a><br><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Clothes Appropriate to the Weather</strong><br>
Temperature and weather extremes are not conditions you should expose your grand folks to. Pack the proper clothes and clothing accessories for them so they won’t end up getting sick in the middle of the vacation, diminishing the experience for them as well as everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Spirit of Fun and Adventure</strong><br>
Everyone’s supposed to be made happy by this trip, so don’t lose sight of that! It’s these moments with the family that your venerable parents treasure, especially towards the last days of their lives.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don’t waste a single moment. Have a load of fun in your vacations as this year unfolds!</p>

<p>Medical alert and home alarm systems have changed the lives of the elderly, sick, disabled, and even their family members; from the way they interact with each other to the comfort they experience and how their families can help. Their relationships have a chance to improve, while enhancing their overall happiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the introduction of medical alert and home alarm systems in the 1970’s, they have gradually become more accessible and affordable, which is extremely beneficial for lower income families that have difficulty paying for such medical supplies. With technological advances and the support of social programs, these families can now benefit from affordable and accessible medical alert systems along with other medical resources.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition to acquiring these medical alert and alarm systems at lower costs and with ease, families experience other benefits through these alert systems that allow them to engage more frequently, support each other and live happier lives. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Home Sweet Home</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The elderly, sick and disabled are now able to live safer, while in the comfort of their own homes, rather than a nursing home, hospital or rehabilitation center. This also depends on the well-being of the person. Sometimes the condition of the person may be too severe not to be placed in one of these establishments. Needless to say, if the condition of the person is manageable and they can support themselves to an extent, then they will have the option of living in their own home.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although medical alert systems sometimes give the elderly, sick and disabled the choice of living at home, this doesn’t mean medical alert systems don’t benefit people in nursing homes, hospitals or rehabilitation centers. They’re quite significant in either case regardless of the location or person. For those lucky enough and who choose to do so, living at home can add more comfort and overall happiness to their lives.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The Parent in All of Us</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For those who’ve experienced parenthood know that it takes much effort, strength and the choice to do so, but in the end it’s all worth it. Parents get to experience the joy of raising their children, but there might come a time when a children take care of their parents, while other times, someone chooses to help a friend or another family member if they become sick, disabled or too old to take care of themselves. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">From my perspective, no elderly person wants to go into a nursing home, which is why a friend or family member can be their caretaker. Similar to parenting, it’s a choice; one that takes strength and much effort. For those willing to do so understand what love, family and friendship truly mean.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once the choice to take care of a family member or friend is made, this is where medical alert and alarm systems assist in the palliative process. A family member or friend won’t be there every second of the day, but with the right balance of medical support and love, these people will live happier knowing that others still care about them and they can live their regular lifestyles to an extent.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Families Ties </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When someone takes care of another family member or friend in a time of weakness it shows they care. Although this person gives up their time for another, it doesn’t mean they won’t receive something in return. Much is actually gained during this time of sacrifice through family bonding, interpersonal connections and friendship. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If someone chooses to help a family member or friend and will always be there for them, then their relationship will grow stronger throughout the palliative process. The caretaker will bond with their family member or friend simply by being there for them.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Medical alert and home alarm systems assist in allowing this bond to occur. These medical systems give family members and friends the potential to connect and grow in their relationships. Other medical technologies also benefit the elderly, sick and disabled, but medical systems, such as alarm and alert systems, are major contributors to the bonding and growth these people experience with others during the palliative process.</span></p>

<div> For individuals with serious medical conditions, medic alert systems can offer a great sense of security in the home. These personal emergency response systems come in the form of pendants which are typically worn around the neck. The simple “one-button” feature to call 911 make these devices extremely user friendly. The pendants are waterproof so they can be worn in the shower or tub for added protection. The typical system can function in a two-story home, cover approximately 3,500 sq. feet, and reach up to 400 feet outside of the house. These systems can aid in the independence of seniors while relieving some anxiety for their family members. There are some things to keep in mind while shopping for a personal emergency response system that is right for you.</div>
<ol><ol>
<li>You need to check with your home phone and internet provider to make sure the system will work with their plan. When choosing a medic alert system, be sure to ask the representative from the company about their compatibility with your provider. They should be able to tell you whether or not the system will work outside of your home. In most cases, a land line will be required. There are a couple of systems that will work anywhere outdoors, The Wellcore Personal Emergency Response System, The MobileHelp Medical Alert System and the Lifestation 911 Phone System , that can connect to some cell phone providers, however, they have limited coverage when activated outside the home.</li>
</ol></ol>
<div></div>
<ol><ol>
<li>Check to see if the system will be installed for you by a representative (usually for a fee), or if the system will come as is. If this is the case be sure there are instructions for installation included.  Either way, it is important to always test the range of the system after installation. The time to find out there are issues with the range outside of your home is NOT when you are having an emergency!</li>
</ol></ol>
<div></div>
<ol><ol>
<li>There are a few extra services that medic alert systems can provide. These include glucose monitoring reminders, and medication alerts. Make sure to ask what added on services can be purchased for your convenience. Some systems come with “fall- down” detection which will alert the system if the user has fallen.</li>
</ol></ol>
<div></div>
<div>Medic alert systems are a valuable tool in a near-home emergency. Whether the problem is a fall, a heart attack, a stroke, or any other emergency brought on by a medical condition, these systems can save a life by the simple press of a button.  Newer systems are now able to be tethered to a cell phone plan, but it is always best to test the range of any system that you choose before you have an emergency.</div>

			<p><a href="http://www.guyane-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Considering-a-Medical-Alert.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-55" title="Considering a Medical Alert" src="http://www.guyane-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Considering-a-Medical-Alert.jpg" alt="Considering a Medical Alert System? 4 Facts You Need To Know" width="194" height="259"></a>Do you remember the old alert medical commercial from the late 80’s? It depicted an elderly woman who could be seen onscreen, lying on the floor, feigning a broken hip. She was shouting, “Help, I’ve fallen and I can’t get up” albeit, rather unconvincingly. While we may have found it comical in nature when we were younger, as we age that commercial seems to hit home more and more. What would you do in the event of an emergency where your parents were incapacitated and you are unavailable?</p>
<p>Medical alert systems made their debut in the 1980’s and have since become essential in the homes of the elderly. There was a time where there was no middle ground for seniors; you had the option of a nursing home or a hospital bed. With these obviously banal options, families were looking for a better solution that would meet the needs of the aging population. Built from this growing need, medical alert systems were born.</p>
<p>Built on the infrastructure of an alarm company, emergency medical alert systems offered a solid solution, providing retirees with the highly desirable option of staying in their homes and retaining a remnant of their independence while ensuring that they are well cared for in the event that unforeseen circumstances should arise and they find themselves home alone.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #1:</strong> The chances of a fatality as the result of a fall increase exponentially as we age.</p>
<p>30% of seniors over the age of 65 will have a tumble this year.</p>
<p><strong> Fact #2</strong>: Of that 30%, the chances of survival are 500% less likely if help does not arrive within the first 12 hours following the incident. If help arrives immediately? You have a 90% chance of survival.</p>
<p><strong> Fact #3:</strong> Statistics compiled from the Consumer Product Safety Council indicate that of all emergency room visits from patients over the age of 65, 60% are due to a slip, trip or fall.</p>
<p><strong> Fact #4</strong>: A quick dash from the kitchen to the bathroom can result in a fall. Generally thought of us as non-fatal injury, falls are the most common cause of injury related death in people aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>If you have an aging parent and are considering your options, medical alert services might just be worth a look. At a glance, the system is simple. In the event that your loved one is injured or sick, they simply press the medical alert button on either their wrist or neck and it notifies the medical alert company who immediately call the appropriate first responders. They also alert medical emergency contacts, so you’ll know what’s happening, while it is happening, putting your family immediately at ease.</p>
<p>There’s no price that can be put on the safety and well being of a loved one. We all want our family with us for as long as possible and to live a long, healthy, independent life and the mass of alert medical devices available today seem to be able to afford us just that.</p>

<p>These days, you don’t need to settle for dull or dowdy alert medical jewelry. Thanks to a host of new medical alert jewelry designs that offer the perfect blend of form and function, you may pick and choose some standout pieces that offer you safety and protection, while actually being a pleasure to wear.</p>
<p>Since wearing alert medical jewelry is a necessity for so many (including people with diabetes, hemophilia, or Alzheimer’s Disease), it’s nice to know that alert medical jewelry is changing with the times to reflect a more modern sensibility.</p>
<p>New Styles, Same Benefits</p>
<p>Examples of appealing new medical alert jewelry styles include medical alert ID bracelets with stainless steel tags and funky beaded bracelets. These designs are mostly popular with the ladies; however, they are technically unisex. Other medical alert wristbands include rugged, masculine style details, such as bold, octagonal steel tags and chunky, chain-link bracelets.</p>
<p>These stylish new medical alert ID bracelets are perfect complements to all types of casual wear. For example, sporty or artsy separates will look perfect with these sorts of designs. However, beaded or chain-link styles do not offer a traditional look, so they may not be perfect options for the boardroom or other semi-formal or formal occasions.</p>
<p>Pendants are Fun and Functional</p>
<p>If you prefer wearing emergency medical alert jewelry, rather than bracelets or wristbands, you are a perfect candidate for today’s hottest new medic alert pendant styles. Lightweight metal chains that feature dog tags engraved with bright, fun colors are popular with men and women alike, and they are very easy to see.</p>
<p>Some of the world’s premier jewelry designers now offer dog tag pendants that may be customized for medic alert jewelry users. Whether you favor classic red or bubble-gum pink, you’ll find that these new pendants offer more style options and a cheery, fun look.</p>
<p>Kids Enjoy Wearing Velcro Medical Alert Wristbands</p>
<p>Kids need secure medical alert bracelets that are also very comfortable to wear. Today, you may order a variety of colorful Velcro wristbands printed with important information and the “medic alert” symbol. These styles come in electric blue, bright green, cherry-red, hot pink, and almost any other color of the rainbow.</p>
<p>Quality will vary, so be sure to look for a reputable retailer before placing an order. Some parents also buy flexible rubber medical alert bracelets that their kids can wear in the pool; these disposable bracelets really come in handy when kids are getting wet.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are a variety of exciting and stylish new medical alert jewelry styles out there in the marketplace. If you need to wear a bracelet all of the time, but you’ve grown weary of wearing the same style every single day, change it up with some new looks that still let medical personnel and passersby know that you have a medical condition. By blending form and function, you’ll enjoy first-rate style that really fits with your personal tastes. These jewelry designs are available at different price points, so it’s possible to find an affordable piece that you will love.</p>

<p>If you know a beloved older relative who needs a medical alerts system, you’re not alone. Today, many people struggle to care for elderly loved ones and to support their continued independence. Choosing the right medical alerts system for a senior is really a perfect way to ensure that he or she will be cared for in the event of falls or other dangerous health issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without this type of system, an elderly person may not be able to reach a phone in order to ask for help. To give you some practical advice about choosing these systems, we’ve compiled a short guide to setting up an alert medical system for your loved one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Choose a Trustworthy Medical Alarm Company</strong> – Medical alarms for elderly are very important accessories that have the potential to save lives. To make sure that you’re buying the best alert medical system on the market, you should consider an alert medical alarm provider’s business reputation. Working with larger companies is usually a pretty safe bet, as these alert medical firms have a bigger network of dedicated response team members who may have specialized EMT (emergency medical technician) training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, some smaller companies do offer personalized services that may be perfect for your elderly relative. When researching companies, be sure to collect quotations for services. If you’re carrying the cost of the system and hardware, you’ll need to know that you’re getting a decent deal for a panic button system and its medical alarm monitoring system. Talking to company representatives online may be an option; however, you may also shop for these medical alert button systems from the comfort and privacy of your own home. Today, many people do purchase alert medical systems via the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>You may rent or buy a base unit and then subscribe to the medical alarm monitoring service. Deciding how to pay is a personal choice. In general, buying a panic button may be a wise decision if you can afford to do this for your elderly relative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Always consult with your elderly relative before ordering a medical alarm for elderly; it’s really important to get his or her input before you make a decision like this. If your relative is resistant to the idea of wearing a panic button, try to gently reinforce the positive benefits of this type of medical alarm system. Let your loved one know that some companies offer wristband panic buttons that may be more to his or her liking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Help Your Relative to Understand the System</strong> - Once you’ve chosen the right system and received an alarm medical device, you’ll need to test out the panic button with your elderly relative to be certain that it’s working correctly.

<ul>
<li><em>Have you begun to worry about the health of an elderly loved one, and perhaps heard of the <strong>elderly personal alarm</strong> in your search to ease the stress?</em></li>
<li><em>Have you noticed a decline in strength or mobility, fainting spells, or been informed by a doctor of increased risks of heart attack or strokes for your loved ones?</em></li>
<li><em>Have you wondered if having a medical alert device is something that could be of benefit of to your family?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em>You are not alone. Millions of people and families around the world have had to find the time to ensure elderly safety for thousands of years. But within our current society, jobs demand longer hours, and families often live far apart from each other.</p>
<p>Caring for our elderly loved ones is not as simple as it used to be. That’s why <strong>personal alarms for the elderly</strong> has been the runaway successful technology that has provided countless families with peace of mind and security, knowing their loved ones will always have access to emergency services.</p>
<p>The following is a series of testimonials from subscribers who have benefited from the simple and effective service of <em>personal alarms for elderly people</em>.</p>
<p><em>“I began using an elderly personal alarm in 2009. I had started to have fainting spells, but fortunately nothing had happened apart from some stiff muscles from falling. About a year after I had subscribed to the service, I had another fainting spell that caused me to break my hip. Without my elderly personal alarm, who knows how long I may have lain on the floor in agony. With it, I was able to get an ambulance within minutes, and my children arrived at the hospital just after I got there. It saved me from a lot of pain, if I had just been lying on the floor with no one to find me!”</em> (Janice, 81)</p>
<p><em> “My father just signed up for a <strong>medical alert device</strong> two months ago. He had a stroke that left him with some difficulty in his mobility, and my brother and I were concerned about his safety, especially going up and down the stairs. He hasn’t had to use it yet, but we certainly feel relieved knowing that he can always access emergency services if anything ever happens to him.”</em> (Joe, 31, and Tony, 34)</p>
<p><em>“My wife and I both use an elderly personal alarm in our home. Even though we live together, we are hard of hearing, and often on separate floors. This way, if an emergency happens, either of us can get the assistance we need without having to worry about calling for each other and maybe not hearing anything. The response center knows that we live together, and can make sure that emergency services know that there are two of us in the house. We are happy to be subscribers, and can go about our own business in the house with peace of mind now.”</em> (Alexander, 75).</p>
<p>Each of these stories demonstrates the practicality and value of getting an elderly personal alarm before you actually find yourself in a situation where you need emergency assistance, but can’t quite get the help you need.</p>
<p>In summary this article shows a series of testimonials describing the essential service of an elderly personal alarm, and how it can be a beneficial contributor to your health while relieving your worries.</p>

Providing an added layer of protection to the family of a senior citizen living at home, </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>medical alert companies</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> delighted the masses by giving older family members the ability to live an independent lifestyle in their own home.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>medical alarm for elderly</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> persons works by notifying a central response center that an incident has occurred. This is done by means of pressing the </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>medical alert button</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">, located a device carried either around the neck, or around the wrist. Of course, the client will need to remember to put the device on in order for it to be able to work, which is obviously problematic if the client suffers from a degeneration or memory disorder such as Alzheimer’s. In any event, once pressed, a signal is sent to the base unit. The base unit will instantaneously place a call to 911 and the response center will later </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>alert medical</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> emergency contacts. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Not very long after </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>medical alarms</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> made their debut that businesses soon realized that it wasn’t just the baby boomers who could make use of their </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>emergency medical alert</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> systems. Literally anyone with any ailment would benefit from these services. Today, the possibilities are endless, with a larger part of the population making use of this invaluable service. Here are just a few of the alternative uses for </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>alert medical equipment</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Merniere’s Disease is an infection of the inner ear, which causes dizziness and lightheadedness. Also known as vertigo, this dizziness can wreak havoc on a person’s ability to use their fine motor skills or even walk. A simple stroll down the hallway can trigger the vertigo, causing you to fall. Sufferers of vertigo and anyone who is at an increased risk for falling would benefit from a medical alarm service.</span></span></li>

<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In America, domestic violence is said to occur every 9 seconds and is the primary cause of injuries to women. If you’ve known a domestic violence victim, then you may also know that it is difficult to convince them to leave or even to seek medical assistance. </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Alert medical</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> companies have started to integrate a silent alarm system into their devices in an effort to help victims contact the police without worrying about reprisal from their abuser.</span></span>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Post surgical recovery can take weeks depending on the procedure. While personal support services are available in the community, access to them is limited and private services can be expensive. Caregiver burnout is common, especially with family members who are looking after recovering parents or children. This is where medical alert comes in handy, giving caregivers a chance to get out of the house to run errands without having the added stress of worrying about their loved ones.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Statistics show that marriage rates have been on a steady decline since the late 1990’s, with more people choosing to live alone rather than cohabitate. Living in a large metropolis can bring new fears, especially if the city is new. Medical emergency monitoring can ease your fears; with help just a button press away.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do you or a family member use </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>alert medical</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> services in a new or alternative way? </span></span></p>
